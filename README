INSTALLING PESDT

Either using git, or just downloading the .zip file from github (https://github.com/lomanowski/PESDT), copy the files to your home. In your home you should have the following structure:
/home/<your_user_name>/PESDT/

in your .bashrc (if on JET-JDC), you should have the following lines:

export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:"/home/adas/python/"
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/PESDT
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:"/u/sim/jintrac/default/libs/eproc/python/eproc"
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:"/u/sim/jintrac/default/libs/eproc/python"

These lines loads the adas and adaslib python routines, PESDT (the program you're about to use), and eproc (used for reading the EDGE2D-EIRENE tranfiles) as importable python libraries.

USING PESDT

PESDT works by generating a background pickle file, and json files of the synthetic diagnostics.
In "PESDT/inputs/" you have input .json files. DO NOT edit the adf11 or adf15 files, unless you explicitly know what you're doing. In the "PESDT/inputs/" there is an commented example file, which explains each of the lines. For some unknown reason, currently any comments in the actual input break the code, so you should only use it as a reference. In the input file, you should define your EDGE2D-EIRENE (or SOLPS, currently untested) tranfile location, the spectoscopic lines, and the instruments you want to synthesize. (Also add your save directory)

NOTE: eproc wants that the tranfile is named just "tran", nothing else will do.

In the terminal, in your home folder, type and enter:

ipython

and in the interactive python environment type and enter:

run PESDT/run_PESDT.py PESDT/inputs/<your_inputfile_name>.json

(i.e. after specifying the run script, add as an argument your input .json file)

PESDT should now run, and you should find, after a while, the ouput pickle and json files under the savedir/<case>

For plotting, edit plot_PESDT.py file to point to your output files, and add the lines/instruments you want to plot.
